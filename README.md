Educational Budgets, Enrollment and Student Scores

Education is the bedrock of personal and societal growth.We delve into the intricate world of education budgets, enrollments and how they correlate with student outcomes.

Using U.S. Census Bureau data and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data from 1994-2015 we analyze trends, patterns, and outcomes to encourage access to and transparency around educational data.

Data Sources

We use the U.S. Census Bureau data and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data from two separate datasets. 
The NAEP data provides a representative measure of student achievement and is administered to U.S. elementary and secondary students.


Primary Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project
Secondary dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noriuk/us-educational-finances?select=districts.csv

Major Hypotheses
1. Examine whether Instruction Expenditure has risen with more students enrolling in states over time.
2. Explore the association between higher educational spending and enhanced math and reading scores in 4th and 8th grade students.
3. Investigate the hypothesis that there are significant regional differences in student performances across various subjects.
4. Explore whether enrollment figures in 4th and 8th grades have a notable influence on average math and reading scores.
5. There are variations in the number of school districts between states.
6. Spending on instruction, support, capital outlay, and other needs is similar across the top twenty school districts.
